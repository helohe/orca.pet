Not on my shift!
================

This is a hosts list for blocking phishing and malware sites that I have encountered through the internet. Normally I'd receive these hosts from spam mails that manage to slip through my email spam filter.

Why not use Malware Domain List or Malware domains?
---------------------------------------------------

Both current built-in lists in uBlock are completely abandoned and seemingly no longer updated.

The first list, [Malware Domains List](https://www.malwaredomainlist.com/), seems not to have received any update [since 2017](https://www.malwaredomainlist.com/mdl.php), as of the writing of this page. None of the websites reported after that year on [the forums](https://www.malwaredomainlist.com/forums/index.php?board=16.0) seem to have been added to said list.

The second one, [Malware Domains](https://www.malwaredomains.com/) seems not to be doing much better either, and the last update on their website seems to be from 2018. Most of the domains listed in said list are long gone.

Isn't there already a built-in anti-phishing in my browser?
-----------------------------------------------------------

While it is true that Google Chrome, Firefox and other mainstream browsers already have built in protection through the [Google Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/) service, this service in my own experience has proven to be slow, which is incredibly frustrating given that every minute that passes the hackers running said phishing websites could be gathering valuable personal data from unsuspecting victims.

The idea of this hosts list is to serve as a temporary measure to block these addresses as soon as possible, within minutes after they're discovered, before they're accepted into the Safe Browsing list.

Where does the name come from?
------------------------------

The name, if you're curious, comes from [a certain scene of The Simpsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQMeYdrt5LQ).
