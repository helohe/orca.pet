Famicom AV mod
==============

My custom composite video modification for the Japanese version of the Nintendo Entertainment System, the NES.

Changelog
---------

### Version 1.2:

![V1.2 PCB]({{ 'pcb_v1.2.png' | cachebuster }})

**WARNING: STILL NOT TESTED**.

* Added a rectifier bridge to accept power bricks with any polarity.
* Replaced fuse with a automatic resettable fuse (PTC), which is smaller and does not need maintenance.
* Slightly tweaked position of switches, which weren't centered relative to the case holes.
* Replaced switches with double rocker switches which are closer to the original ones in the Famicom in terms of size.

### Version 1.1:

![V1.1 PCB]({{ 'pcb_v1.1.png' | cachebuster }})

Current revision in use for installation in consoles.

* Added support for the HC Famicom revision, which has a different video section and PCB layout.
* Added support for the power rocker in the H revision, which I forgot to include in v1.0.
* Added switches on the back of the console, one for controlling the smoothing on the H revision and a decorative one.

### Version 1.0:

* First revision.
* Only used in a single console.
